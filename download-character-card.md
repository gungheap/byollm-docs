# Download Character Card

You need to save the character card to your iPhone's **Files app**.

**Important: Do not** use "Save to Photos" or "Copy Image" because it will remove the character data from the image.

**Important: use chrome.** Do not use Safari because it damages the png file.

*Future: Share image to app works in some cases, but not yet working from chrome or safari.*
