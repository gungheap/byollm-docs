# Start the Scenario: The Caffeinated Gauntlet

This scenario is a zany quest to get coffee in a highly bureaucratic workplace.

1.  In the app's **Settings** tab, go to `Manage Character Cards`. You will see a list of your imported character cards.

2.  Select "The Caffeinated Gauntlet" from the list.

3.  To start the chat, you have two options:
    *   **Option 1:** Long-press on "The Caffeinated Gauntlet" in the list and tap "Start Chat".

    *   **Option 2:** After selecting the card, go to the main chat view and tap the speech bubble icon to start a new chat with that character.

May your quest for coffee be swift and your TPS reports be few!
